# Multi-Link Opener

Multi-Link Opener is a Chrome extension that allows you to open multiple links at once by simply drawing a box around them.

## How to Use

1.  **Press and Hold Shift**: Press and hold the `Shift` key on any webpage.
2.  **Click and Drag**: While holding `Shift`, click your mouse and drag to draw a selection box over the links you want to open.
3.  **Link Counter**: As you draw, a counter will appear at the top-left corner of the box, showing the number of unique links selected.
4.  **Release to Open**: Release the mouse button to open all the selected links in new, inactive background tabs.
5.  **Cancel**: To cancel the selection at any time, simply release the `Shift` key before you release the mouse button.

## Features

*   **Efficient Link Opening**: Open dozens of links simultaneously without having to right-click or middle-click each one.
*   **Visual Feedback**: A clear selection box and a live link counter show you exactly what you're selecting.
*   **Non-Intrusive**: The extension is only active when the `Shift` key is held down, preventing accidental selections.
*   **Duplicate Prevention**: If you select the same link multiple times, it will only be opened once.
*   **Visited Indicator**: Opened links are styled with a purple color, just like standard visited links, so you know which ones you've already opened with the extension.
*   **Badge Counter**: The extension icon will display a badge with the number of links currently selected.
*   **Staggered Tab Opening**: Opens tabs sequentially with a slight delay to prevent browser freezing when opening many links at once.
